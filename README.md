### Summary

This app uses the [Metropolitan Museum of Art's API](https://metmuseum.github.io/) which contains images and information about thousands of artworks in its catalog. Simply enter a keyword and the app will return an array of catalog items related to the keyword which you can scroll through with a click of a button. Each item description contains relevant useful information and the images are clickable and lead to a full-size image in a separate tab. 

Note: Some keywords will not be apparent in the item description, however, they exist within a different attribute in the backend that may not be displayed for UX purposes.

- CSS 
- JS
